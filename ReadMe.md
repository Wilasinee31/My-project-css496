###Disease classification in tomato leaf with machine learning
This project study about tomato leaf disease classificaion with machine learning and applied Image Enhancement to help machine learning(CNN) to classified tomato leaf disease better or not? The process use OpenCV to do Image Enhancement, convolutional neural network with keras to do in this project. The Result is the prediction of tomato leaf disease.
### Contents
-Floder Code have 4 Floders in each images enhancement method with CNN
-Floder dataset is the dataset to training and testing model 
-model1.h5 is the model to predict tomato leaf disease
### Technology Use
-OpenCV
-Tensorflow for keras
